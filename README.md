## Purpose
This app is designed to provided a frontend to a SSL analysis service hosted by SSL labs infrastructures.
The app was built using Vue-js, including the use of a basic Vue Bootstrap template from creative-tim (https://www.creative-tim.com/).
Apart from the styles and basic infrastructure the template provides, all code is original and my personal work.
